This project showcases a simple Python-based command-line chatbot that interacts with users through text input in the terminal. It can handle basic conversations, answer predefined questions, and perform simple tasks like setting reminders or providing information (such as the current time or date). The chatbot is implemented using basic conditional statements, making it a great project for beginners looking to learn text processing, user input handling, and foundational conversational AI techniques.

Features:
Basic Conversations: The chatbot responds to common queries, such as asking for its name, the current time, or today’s date. It also engages in small talk, including responding to "How are you?" or "Thank you."
Task Management: Users can set simple reminders during the conversation. Currently, reminders are stored in the session, but this functionality can be extended in future versions to include actual alerts or notifications.
Exit Mechanism: Users can end the conversation by typing "exit" or "bye," making it easy to terminate the program when needed.
Lightweight and Simple: The chatbot is designed using basic Python, making it easy to understand, run, and modify. No external libraries are required, so it’s perfect for learning or quick prototyping.

How to Use:
Clone the repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/your-username/command-line-chatbot.git
Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
Run the chatbot with: python chatbot.py
Begin chatting with the bot by typing commands or questions directly into the terminal.

Future Enhancements:
NLP Integration: Incorporating natural language processing (NLP) libraries such as nltk or spaCy to enable more sophisticated, human-like responses.
Reminder System: Expanding the current reminder functionality to allow for timed reminders or notifications.
This project is ideal for beginners looking to practice Python and build a basic conversational AI system.
